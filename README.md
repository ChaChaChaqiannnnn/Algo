Project Overview
This project implements and analyzes the performance of sorting and searching algorithms: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Binary Search. These algorithms are applied to a dataset consisting of randomly generated integers and strings. The goal is to compare their time and space complexities, and observe their behavior with large datasets.

Algorithms Implemented
Merge Sort
A stable sorting algorithm that recursively divides the dataset into smaller sublists and merges them in sorted order.

Quick Sort
A non-stable sorting algorithm that uses the last element as a pivot to partition the dataset and recursively sorts the sublists.

Binary Search
A search algorithm that finds a target element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

Dataset
The dataset consists of randomized integers (unique, up to 1 billion) and strings.

A sample dataset of 1 million elements is generated for testing the sorting and searching algorithms.


Conclusion
The best sorting algorithm is determined based on runtime and space efficiency.

A comparison of AVL using an array vs linked structure is provided to discuss the trade-offs in terms of performance.
